# Sparse-Matrix

sparseMatrix.c file takes an original sparse matrix as input and outputs a three tuple matrix.

sparseTranspose.c file takes 3-tuple sparse matrx as input and prints the transpose of it, with time complexity O(n*t), 'n' is number of columns and 't' is number of non-zero entrries.

sparseFastTranspose.c file takes 3-tuple sparse matrx as input and prints the fast-transpose of it, with time complexity O(n+t), 'n' is number of columns and 't' is number of non-zero entrries.
